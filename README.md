### Earthquake (EQ) Events Explorer
<p align="justify">The web app aims to visualize the earthquake events that occurred within Philippine archipelago as recorded by the <a href="https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/">Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS)</a> (2017-present) and the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/">United States Geological Survey (USGS)</a> (1910-present). The data contains historical earthquake events information such as location, magnitude, depth, among others, in CSV format.<br>
<br>The web app is designed to be interactive with features that enable users to drill down into the data by selecting their preferred attributes, such as the source of data, temporal filters, magnitude, and depth filters, to answer specific questions one might have.

### Typhoon Track Explorer:
<p align="justify">The web app aims to visualize the typhoon tracks that entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) dated 1980 - present. The data was downloaded from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=ib-v4-access">International Best Track for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)</a>. The data contains three-hourly (3H) information of the location, maximum winds, pressure, among others of all known typhoons, in CSV format.<br><br>
The web app is interactive. It has a control panel that enables users to drill down into the data by selecting their preferred filters. For example, users can opt to filter the data using the temporal filters (month, year, or date), spatial filters (using provincial boundaries), and typhoon name filters (International name) to answer specific questions one might have.</justify>
